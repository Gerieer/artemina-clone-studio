Verification notes — CSS-only fullpage scroll-snap
===============================================

Date: 2025-10-25

Summary
-------
I verified that the site uses a CSS-only fullpage scroll-snap implementation (no JS controlling wheel/trackpad). The verification below lists the checks performed and the results.

Automated checks run
- Build: `npm run build` — success (Vite build completed).
- Lint: `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 7 warnings (existing react-refresh warnings; non-blocking).

Files inspected
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` — uses `h-screen snap-y snap-mandatory overflow-y-auto scroll-smooth` on the parent and wraps each main section in `min-h-screen snap-start` containers.
- `src/components/Hero.tsx` — background image is absolutely positioned with an overlay; textual content uses `relative z-10` so it remains above the background.
- `src/components/Introduction.tsx` — text and image are in a two-column grid; image uses `relative` and decorative gradient is `absolute` with reduced opacity to avoid occlusion.

Visual overlap checks (manual code inspection)
- Hero: the background is `absolute` and the content is placed in a `relative z-10` container; this prevents image overlapping the text. The overlay gradient (semi-transparent) helps text readability.
- Introduction: image and text are in distinct grid cells; the image is `relative` with a blurred background behind it, not in front of text. `w-full h-auto` keeps image aspect ratio.
- Gallery and About: these sections use standard flow layout and spacing (`py-20`, `max-w-*`) to avoid content overlap.

Manual testing steps for you (recommended)
1. Start dev server: `npm install` (if needed) then `npm run dev`.
2. Open in desktop browser and scroll with mouse wheel/trackpad — the page should snap to each full-screen section naturally (native CSS snap).
3. Test on mobile (or responsive device toolbar) — scrolling should be native and smooth; no forced JS snapping.
4. Check each section (Hero, Introduction, About, Gallery, Contact) that images are not covering text and that headings remain readable.

If anything looks overlapping
- Identify the section and I'll apply a targeted fix, such as:
  - Adding `z-10` to text containers or lowering `z-index` on decorative background elements.
  - Adjusting padding/margins or switching `items-center` to `items-start` for tall content.

Commits and push
- This verification file was added and pushed to the repository to document the checks performed.
